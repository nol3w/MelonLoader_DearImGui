A melon loader mod base with Dear ImGui menu using interprocess communication. The C# dll is for MelonLoader and almost everything else, the C++ dll is for the DirectX hook and Dear ImGui menu).
I haven't tested this on any Mono games, this was originally made for a IL2CPP game using Melon Loader v0.6.5 (IL2CPP).
Everything you need to get started should be in Menu.cpp, Menu.h, and Main.cs
